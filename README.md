## Description
This application was built for a members-only sailing club in Sydney, Australia. It allows non-members and guests of members to sign-in (via a physical QR code at recption) and enter the premises. Upon submitting the required information, the front-facing application redirects the guest to a confirmation page and display a ticket code for future reference. 

Each successful form submission is logged to a 'records' table on a SQL database and is accessible via a secure admin panel (located at './admin/records'). Once logged in, authorized users can access a custom data table of processed records with a number of sort and filter methods: 
 - asc/desc based on name, ticket no, address, date, etc.
 - filter by substring contained within a record, or by start/end date range,
 
 Records can also be manually created or deleted from the admin UI. To ensure data integrity, individual records cannot be updated/edited (they must be deleted and then re-entered using the current timestamp, if necessary).
