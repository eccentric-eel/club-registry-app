## Description
This application was built for a members-only sailing club in Sydney, Australia. It allows non-members and members of guests to sign-in (via a physical QR code at recption) and enter the premises. Upon submitting the required information, the front-facing application redirects the guest to a confirmation page and display a ticket code for future reference. 

Each successful form submission is logged to a 'records' table on a SQL database and is accessible via a secure admin panel (located at './admin/records').
